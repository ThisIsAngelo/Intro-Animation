## Hey guys! This source code is just for learning purposesðŸ˜¸ Feel free to explore how to create simple CSS animations like the one in the video. Keep in mind, though, I donâ€™t recommend using this in a live website since it might slow down your web performance. Use it to practice and get inspired, and later you can dive into more optimized animation tools. Enjoy experimenting!
